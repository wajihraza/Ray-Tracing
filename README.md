# Ray-Tracing
This repository contains the ray tracer code I worked on for my GPU programming course. The code illuminates spheres, handles colored objects and lighting, and implements ray-traced shadows (intersections during lighting). 

The code is also parallelized using C++ threads library to perform computations efficiently. 

I also wrote a parallel CUDA implementation, which can be seen in the .cu file.
